# Dehazing-using-GAN
Hazy images can severely degrade visual clarity, impacting applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing. This project presents an AI-powered solution to remove haze from both images and real-time video streams using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and deep learning.
